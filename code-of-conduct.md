Code of Conduct
==========

This is a set of rules to make sure we keep a fun, welcoming, challenging, and fair place to work. This Code of Conduct (COC) states our shared ideals with respect to conduct. Think of this as coding standards for people. It is an expression of our ideals, not a rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the entire community.

This code of conduct is inspired by that used by Drupal and Ubuntu.

1. Be considerate
----------

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those consequences into account when making decisions. The websites we create have users and other contributors. Even if it's not obvious at the time, your solutions will impact the work of others. For example, changes to code, infrastructure, policy, documentation, and translations during a release may negatively impact others' work.



<a name="respectfull"></a>
2. Be respectful
----------

We treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a cooperation where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Everyone is expected to be respectful when dealing with other stakeholders, users, developers etc. as well as with people outside of the project.



<a name="collaborative"></a>
3. Be collaborative
----------

Collaboration is central to a project and to it's success. This collaboration involves individuals with very different backgrounds and sometimes different goals for the project working with each other in teams, and teams within the project working with other projects outside. This collaboration is for the benefit of the project, and should improve the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we should always be open to collaboration. Wherever possible, we should work closely with upstream projects and others in the software community to coordinate our technical, advocacy, documentation, and other work. Our work should be done transparently and we should involve as many interested parties as early as possible. If we decide to take a different approach than others, we will let them know early, document our work and inform others regularly of our progress.



<a name="disagreements"></a>
4. When we disagree, we consult others
----------

The title pretty much says it all.

Solving disagreement is important to do in a timely manner and respectful way. Please seek help from other team members or stakeholders within the project when disagrements can't be solved through a simple and constructive discussion.

Please speak up if you notice disagreement and have the conclusions that can end it.



<a name="unsure"></a>
5. When we are unsure, we ask for help
----------

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked questions should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, it is also important to respect an answer that might not be what was expected.



<a name="stepping_down"></a>
6. Step down considerately
----------

Members of projects come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that they do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.
